<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong>
For grading purposes, completing either version of the project
(this original version or the Challenge version) will be equivalent.</p></blockquote>

<!-- blockquote hack -->

<blockquote><p><strong>Important submission note</strong>: For full credit,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submit with Part I complete (including passing all tests provided in
  <code>tests.scm</code>) by <strong>Sunday, November 13</strong> (worth 2 pts).
  Submit with all phases complete by <strong>Tuesday, November 22</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone will automatically receive 2 EC points. By passing the tests for the EC question, you will receive 1 additional EC point. If you complete and submit the entire project by <strong>Monday, November 21</strong>, you will receive 1 additional EC point.</p>

<p>Try to attempt the problems in order, as some later problems will depend
on earlier problems in their implementation and therefore also when
running <code>ok</code> tests.</p>

<p>The entire project can be completed with a partner.</p></blockquote>

<!-- blockquote hack -->

<blockquote><p>Unlike the standard version of the project, there is only one checkpoint, not two.</p>

<p>We've written a <a href="../../articles/scheme-spec/index.html">language specification</a> and <a href="../../articles/scheme-builtins/index.html">built-in procedure
reference</a> for the CS 61A subset of Scheme that you'll be building
in this project. You will not be responsible for implementing everything in
these documents, but what you do implement should be consistent with the
descriptions here.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is an alternate "extreme" version of the standard Scheme project that gives
you <em>much</em> less guidance than the normal version. Traditionally, students without substantial prior programming experience have found this version of the project very difficult. Completing this version
is, for grading purposes, equivalent to completing the standard version of Project 4.
Completing this version will not give you any more credit than is possible by completing
the standard version - it's just here if you want a challenging experience.</p>

<p>Part I will contain very little provided code. Part II, writing programs in
Scheme, will be identical to the standard version.</p>

<p>You should not expect much assistance from staff if you choose to complete
this version of the project. You can always switch to the standard version
if you get stuck.</p>

<p>As a disclaimer, this version has not been tested to the same extent as the main project.
If you believe you've found an error in the
specifications, tests, or provided files, please let us know on Piazza and we will get
it fixed as soon as possible.</p>

<blockquote><p>When students in the past have tried to implement the functions without
thoroughly reading the problem description, they’ve often run into issues.
😱
<strong>Read each description thoroughly before starting to code.</strong></p></blockquote>


<h2 id="download-starter-files">Download starter files</h2>


<p>You can download all of the project code as a <a href="scheme_stubbed.zip">zip archive</a>.</p>

  <li><code>scheme_eval_apply.py</code>: the recursive evaluator for Scheme expressions</li>
  <li><code>scheme_forms.py</code>: evaluation for special forms</li>
  <li><code>scheme_classes.py</code>: classes that describe Scheme expressions</li>
  <li><code>questions.scm</code>: contains skeleton code for Part II</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of the files in the project:</p>

<ul>

<!-- <p>Remember that you can earn an additional bonus point by submitting the
  project at least 24 hours before the deadline.</p> -->



<p>The project is worth  points.
28 points are for correctness,
which is including 1 point for passing <code>tests.scm</code>.
2 points are assigned for submitting Part I by the checkpoint.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are some extra credit point opportunities.
You can get 1 EC point for submitting the entire project by
<strong>Monday, November 21</strong>, and
1 EC point for submitting the extra credit problem.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong>
In order to receive all of the possible extra credit points for Scheme,
your implementation of the entire project,
<em>including</em> the EC problem,
must be submitted by the early submission deadline.</p></blockquote>


<p>You will turn in the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>scheme_eval_apply.py</code></li>
  <li><code>scheme_forms.py</code></li>
  <li><code>scheme_classes.py</code></li>
  <li><code>questions.scm</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the
project. To submit the project, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok --submit</code></pre>

<p>You will be able to view your submissions on the <a
  href="http://ok.cs61a.org">Ok dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p><b>However, please do not modify any other functions or edit any files not
listed above</b>. Doing so may result in your code failing our autograder tests.
Also, please do not change any function signatures (names, argument order, or
number of arguments).</p>



<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code.
It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems.
However, you should not be testing <i>too</i> often, to allow yourself time to
think through problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <b>autograder</b> called <code>ok</code> to help you
with testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run the
autograder, you will be asked to <b>log in with your Ok account using your web
browser</b>. Please do so. Each time you run <code>ok</code>, it will back up
your work and progress on our servers.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of <code>ok</code> is to test your implementations.</p>

<!-- <p>First, some of the test cases are <i>locked</i>. To unlock tests, run the
following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -u</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like:</p>

<pre>
=====================================================================
Assignment: Scheme Interpreter (Challenge Version)
Ok, version ...
=====================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlocking tests

At each "? ", type what you would expect the output to be.
Type exit() to quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 0 &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Code here
?
</pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be. If you
are correct, then this test case will be available the next time you run the
autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <i>conceptually</i> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you can check the
correctness of your program using the tests that you have unlocked:</p>

<pre>python3 ok</pre>

<p>Most of the time, you will want to focus on a particular question. Use the
<code>-q</code> option as directed in the problems below.</p>  -->

<!-- <p>Second, there may be some test cases that are <i>hidden</i>. These test cases are
<b>not</b> run by the command:</p> -->

<!--<pre>python3 ok</pre>-->

<!-- <p>They are only run when you submit:</p> -->

<!-- <pre>python3 ok --submit</pre> -->

<!-- <p> We keep test cases hidden to ensure that you write your code with the intention
of solving the question at hand, not purely to pass the given tests. The hidden
tests will be run when you submit your project. You will receive an email with part of
the autograder results after submitting. However, the autograder has a 15 minute
cooldown period. If you submit before 15 minutes have passed, the autograder will
not run.</p> -->

<p>We recommend that you submit <b>after you finish each
problem</b>. Only your last submission will be graded. It is also useful for us
to have more backups of your code in case you run into a submission issue. <b>If you forget to submit, your last backup will be automatically converted to a submission. </b></p>

<!--<p>After you run this command, you will receive an email (to the address-->
<!--that you used to sign up for Ok) that has the output from all <i>failed</i>-->
<!--unlocked tests, including hidden tests, along with your score at the bottom. You-->
<!--can continue submitting until you pass all the tests. However, you will receive-->
<!--<b>at most one email every half hour</b>.</p>-->

<!--<p>This buffer period is meant for you and your partner to try and understand-->
<!--where your error comes from, and take some time to think through your code. We-->
<!--encourage you to do this for all projects.</p>-->

<!---
<p>If you are trying to debug a test failure, you can launch an interactive session
after the test is run with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 05 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>This will run the tests and launch an interactive session if a test does not
pass.</p>

<!--- <p>The <code>tests</code> folder is used to store autograder tests, so
<b>do not modify it</b>. You may lose all your unlocking progress if you
do. If you need to get a fresh copy, you can download the
<a href="scheme.zip">zip archive</a> and copy it over, but you
will need to start unlocking from scratch.</p> -->

<p>If you do not want us to record a backup of your work or information about
your progress, you can run

<pre>python3 ok --local</pre>


With this option, no information will be sent to our course
servers.

If you want to test your code interactively, you can run

<pre> python3 ok -q [question number] -i </pre>

with the appropriate question number (e.g. <code>01</code>) inserted.
This will run the tests for that question until the first one you failed,
then give you a chance to test the functions you wrote interactively.</p>

<p>You can also use the debugging print feature in OK by writing

<pre> print("DEBUG:", x) </pre>

which will produce an output in your terminal without causing OK tests to fail
with extra output.

<h2 id="interpreter-details">Interpreter details</h2>



<h3 id="scheme-features">Scheme features</h3>


<p><strong>Read-Eval-Print.</strong> The interpreter reads Scheme expressions, evaluates them,
and displays the results.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; 2
2
scm&gt; (+ 2 3)
5
scm&gt; ((lambda (x) (* x x)) 5)
25</code></pre>



<p>The starter code for your Scheme interpreter will not work on these expressions (a single number, a call to a built-in procedure, and a computation of 5 squared) just yet.</p>

<p><strong>Load.</strong> You can load a file by passing in a symbol for the file name.
For example, to load <code>tests.scm</code>, evaluate the following call expression.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (load &#x27;tests)</code></pre>



<p><strong>Symbols.</strong> Various dialects of Scheme are more or less permissive
about identifiers (which serve as symbols and variable names).</p>

<p>Our rule is that:</p>

<blockquote><p>An identifier is a sequence of letters (a-z and A-Z), digits, and characters
in <code>!$%&amp;*/:&lt;=&gt;?@^_~&#x2d;+.</code> that do not form a valid integer or floating-point
numeral and are not existing special form shorthands.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our version of Scheme is case-insensitive: two identifiers are considered
identical if they differ only in the capitalization of letters.
They are internally represented and printed in lower case:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; &#x27;Hello
hello</code></pre>



<p><strong>Turtle Graphics.</strong> In addition to standard Scheme procedures, we include
procedure calls to the Python <code>turtle</code> package. This will come in handy
for the contest. You <strong>do not</strong> have to install this package in order to participate.</p>

<p>If you're curious, you can read the <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/turtle.html">turtle module
documentation</a> online.</p>


<h3 id="running-the-interpreter">Running the interpreter</h3>


<p>To start an interactive Scheme interpreter session, type:</p>

<pre><code>python3 scheme.py</code></pre>

<p>Currently, your Scheme interpreter can handle a few simple expressions, such as:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; 1
1
scm&gt; 42
42
scm&gt; true
#t</code></pre>



<p>To exit the Scheme interpreter, press <code>Ctrl&#x2d;d</code> or evaluate the <code>exit</code> procedure:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (exit)</code></pre>



<p>You can use your Scheme interpreter to evaluate the expressions in an input file
by passing the file name as a command-line argument to <code>scheme.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 scheme.py tests.scm</code></pre>

<p>The <code>tests.scm</code> file contains a long list of sample Scheme expressions and
their expected values. Many of these examples are from Chapters 1 and 2 of
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, the textbook from
which Composing Programs is adapted.</p>


<h2 id="part-i-the-evaluator">Part I: The Evaluator</h2>

<!-- separate bq -->

<p>In <code>scheme_eval_apply.py</code> we've provided a function definition for <code>scheme_eval</code> - you should not
change the signature of this function, as it is called in the read-eval-print-loop. However,
the implementation of this function is up to you. It should be able to evaluate atomic expressions
and combinations, including self-evaluating expressions, names, call expressions, and special forms.</p>


<h4 id="problem-1-8-pt">Problem 1 (8 pt)</h4>


<p>In this problem, you will implement the core functionality of the interpreter. You should fill in the <code>scheme_eval</code> function
and add any necessary functions/classes so that your interpreter is able to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Evaluate self-evaluating atomic expressions including numbers, booleans, and nil</li>
  <li>Evaluate symbols by looking up their value in the current environment</li>
  <li>Apply built-in procedures (e.g. <code>+</code> and <code>cons</code>)</li>
  <li>Evaluate call expressions</li>
  <li>Add bindings to the current environment using the <code>define</code> special form.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the <code>quote</code> special form</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, you do not need to worry about creating user-defined procedures using the <code>define</code> special form (although you will
in the next part). That is, your interpreter should be able to handle expressions such as <code>(define x 1)</code> but not <code>(define (foo x) 1)</code>
after this question.</p>

<p>Remember to refer to the <a href="../../articles/scheme-spec/index.html#define">Scheme Specifications</a> in order to determine the behavior of <code>define</code> (and other special forms).</p>

<p>We've provided a few classes that you will use in this part:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>Frame</code> class is used to contain and organize the bindings in a specific frame. An instance of the <code>Frame</code> class is passed in to <code>scheme_eval</code> as <code>env</code>.</li>
  <li><p>The <code>BuiltinProcedure</code> class inherits from the <code>Procedure</code> class (since your interpreter should handle both user-defined and built-in procedures). The constructor for a <code>BuiltinProcedure</code> creates two instance attributes</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>py_func</code> is a <em>Python</em> function implementing the built-in scheme procedure</li>
    <li><code>need_env</code> is a Boolean that indicates whether or not the built-in procedure expects the current environemnt to be passed in as the
    last argument. The environment is required, for instance, to implement the built-in <code>eval</code> procedure.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>You may add any attributes or methods to these classes you see fit in order to implement the above functionality.</p>

<p>Here are some other tips for this question:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To see a list of all Scheme built-in procedures used in the project, look in the <code>scheme_builtins.py</code> file. Any function decorated with
  <code>@builtin</code> will be added to the globally-defined <code>BUILTINS</code> list. You can use any of these procedures in your tests.</li>
  <li>You may want to take a look at some methods contained in the <code>Pair</code> class - for example, the <code>map</code> method of <code>Pair</code> can apply a
  <em>one-argument function</em> to every item in a Scheme list.</li>
  <li>While built-in procedures follow the normal rules of evaluation (evaluate operator, evaluate operands, apply operator to
  operands), applying the operator does <em>not</em> create a new frame.</li>
  <li>In order to implement the <code>quote</code> special form, you will have to both evaluate the expression correctly in
  the <code>scheme_eval</code> function and make sure your parser is able to correctly form these expressions. The output of the parser should
  substitute an equivalent expression using the <code>quote</code> keyword if it sees the
  following token: <code>&#x27;</code>.</li>
  <li>How you implement special forms is up to you, but we recommend you encapsulate the
  logic for each special form separately somehow.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="problem-2-7-pt">Problem 2 (7 pt)</h4>


<p>In this problem, you will implement user-defined expressions and some related features.
After this, your interpreter should be able to accomplish the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Evaluating <code>begin</code> and <code>lambda</code> special forms</li>
  <li>Creating user-defined functions when evaluating the <code>define</code> special form</li>
  <li>Applying lambda functions and user-defined procedures to arguments in a call expression</li>
</ul>

<p>Although you added some functionality for call expressions in the previous part, user-defined procedures require some special handling. In
particular, built-in procedures do <em>not</em> require creating new frames when you call them. However, user-defined procedures will require
creating a new <code>Frame</code> (which we will use in accordance with the rules for calling functions we've learned in the class so far).</p>

<p>Here are some additional hints and clarifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <code>begin</code> special form should evaluate to an undefined value if there are no sub-expressions to evaluate. The way we will represent
  this in the interpreter is by returning the Python value <code>None</code>.</li>
  <li>User-defined procedures in Scheme are the same as lambda procedures. For example, the expression <code>(define (foo x) x)</code> binds the
  value <code>(lambda (x) x)</code> to the name <code>foo</code> in the current environment.</li>
  <li>The body of a procedure can contain multiple expressions, which will be represented as a list of expressions. Only the value that the
  final expression evaluates to will be returned by the function call.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of expressions your interpreter should now be able to evaluate:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (begin (+ 2 3) (+ 5 6))
11
scm&gt; (define x (begin (display 3) (newline) (+ 2 3)))

  <li><code>let</code></li>
  <li><code>mu</code></li>

<p>Make sure to read the <a href="../../articles/scheme-spec/index.html">Scheme Specifications</a> for information on these special forms. Here are some clarifications on their behavior
which are not mentioned in the specifications.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>and</code> and <code>or</code> should exhibit short-circuiting behavior as in Python and evaluate left to right.</li>
  <li><code>mu</code> procedures follow the same evaluation rules as lambda procedures (evaluate the operator, evaluate the operand, apply the operator
  to the operands). However, <code>mu</code> procedures are <em>dynamically scoped</em> - meaning the <code>Frame</code> created by calling a <code>mu</code> procedure should have its parent as the <code>Frame</code> it is called in, not the <code>Frame</code> it was defined in.</li>

<h2 id="part-ii-write-some-scheme">Part II: Write Some Scheme</h2>


<blockquote><p>Not only is your Scheme interpreter itself a tree-recursive program, but it is
flexible enough to evaluate <em>other</em> recursive programs. Implement the

about the behavior of a built-in Scheme procedure, like the difference between
<code>pair?</code> and <code>list?</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The autograder tests for the interpreter are <em>not</em> comprehensive, so you may
have uncaught bugs in your implementation. Therefore, you may find it useful to
test your code for these questions in the staff interpreter or the
<a href="https://code.cs61a.org/scheme">web editor</a> and then try it in your own interpreter once you are
confident your Scheme code is working. You can also use the web editor to
visualize the scheme code you've written and help you debug.</p>


<h3 id="scheme-editor">Scheme Editor</h3>


<p>As you're writing your code, you can debug using the Scheme Editor. In your <code>scheme</code> folder you will find a new editor. To run this editor, run <code>python3 editor</code>. This should pop up a window in your browser; if it does not, please navigate to <a href="localhost:31415">localhost:31415</a> and you should see it.</p>

<h3 id="problem-ec-1-pt">Problem EC (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Modify your interpreter to allow for evaluation that is properly tail recursive. That is, the
interpreter will allow an unbounded number of active <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail calls</a> in constant
space.</p>

<p>One way to implement tail recursive behavior is to delay the evaluation of expressions in tail
contexts and then evaluate it at a later time. You can do this by wrapping an expression in an <code>Unevaluated</code>. An <code>Unevaluated</code> is an object that contains all the information needed to evaluate that expression even outside
the frame of <code>scheme_eval</code>. We would recommend creating an <code>Unevaluated</code> class representing an expression that needs to be evaluated in an environment that can then be instantiated to encapsulate this information.</p>

<p>You will then have to modify your <code>scheme_eval</code> function to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Determine whether or not an expression is in a tail context and create <code>Unevaluated</code>s as appropriate</li>
  <li>Handle evaluation of <code>Unevaluated</code>s if one is passed in to <code>scheme_eval</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You should not change the order or types of any of  the arguments to <code>scheme_eval</code>.</p>

<p>You will likely have to modify other parts of the program besides <code>scheme_eval</code> in order to determine
which expressions are in tail contexts.</p>

<p>After you have implemented tail recursion, you will need to modify the implementation of <code>complete_apply</code>.
This function is needed to implement the built-in <code>apply</code> procedure, as well as a few other built-in procedures.
You may additionally find it useful for your own code.</p>

<p>Currently, <code>complete_apply</code> just returns the result of calling <code>scheme_apply</code>. However, <code>complete_apply</code> differs
from <code>scheme_apply</code> in that it should never return an <code>Unevaluated</code>.
Therefore, if <code>scheme_apply</code> returns an <code>Unevaluated</code>, you should extract and evaluate the expression contained inside the
<code>Unevaluated</code> instead, ensuring that you do not return an <code>Unevaluated</code>.</p>

<h3 id="optional-problem-1-0-pt">Optional Problem 1 (0 pt)</h3>

<p>Macros allow the language itself to be extended by the user. Simple macros can
be provided with the <code>define&#x2d;macro</code> special form. This must be used like a
procedure definition, and it creates a procedure just like <code>define</code>. However,
this procedure has a special evaluation rule: it is applied to its arguments
without first evaluating them. Then the result of this application is
evaluated.</p>

<p>This final evaluation step takes place in the caller's frame, as if the return
value from the macro was literally pasted into the code in place of the macro.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (define (map f lst) (if (null? lst) nil (cons (f (car lst)) (map f (cdr lst)))))
scm&gt; (define&#x2d;macro (for formal iterable body)
....     (list &#x27;map (list &#x27;lambda (list formal) body) iterable))
scm&gt; (for i &#x27;(1 2 3)
....     (print (* i i)))
1
4
9
(None None None)</code></pre>



<p>The code above defines a macro <code>for</code> that acts as a <code>map</code> except that it doesn't
need a lambda around the body.</p>

<p>Implement a <code>define&#x2d;macro</code> special form and make the necessary changes to <code>scheme_eval</code> so that
calls to macro procedures are evaluated correctly.</p>

<h3 id="optional-problem-2-0-pt">Optional Problem 2 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>In Scheme, source code is data. Every non-atomic expression is written as a Scheme list, so we can write procedures that manipulate other programs just as we write procedures that manipulate lists.</p>

<p>Rewriting programs can be useful: we can write an interpreter that only handles a small core of the language, and then write a procedure that converts other special forms into the core language before a program is passed to the interpreter.</p>

<p>For example, the <code>let</code> special form is equivalent to a call expression that begins with a <code>lambda</code> expression. Both create a new frame extending the current environment and evaluate a body within that new environment.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">(let ((a 1) (b 2)) (+ a b))
;; Is equivalent to:
((lambda (a b) (+ a b)) 1 2)</code></pre>



<p>These expressions can be represented by the following diagrams:</p>



        <div class="table-responsive">
          <table class="table table-bordered">
          
  <tr>
    <th>Let</th>
    <th>Lambda</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="images/let.png" alt="let" width="" height=""></td>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="images/lambda.png" alt="lambda" width="" height=""></td>
  </tr>

          </table>
        </div>
        



<p>Use this rule to implement a procedure called <code>let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda</code> in <code>questions.scm</code> that rewrites all <code>let</code> special forms into <code>lambda</code> expressions. If we quote a <code>let</code> expression and pass it into this procedure, an equivalent <code>lambda</code> expression should be returned:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda &#x27;(let ((a 1) (b 2)) (+ a b)))
((lambda (a b) (+ a b)) 1 2)
scm&gt; (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda &#x27;(let ((a 1)) (let ((b a)) b)))
((lambda (a) ((lambda (b) b) a)) 1)
scm&gt; (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda 1)
1
scm&gt; (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda &#x27;a)
a</code></pre>



<p>In order to handle all programs, <code>let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda</code> must be aware of Scheme syntax. Since Scheme expressions are recursively nested, <code>let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda</code> must also be recursive. In fact, the structure of <code>let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda</code> is somewhat similar to that of <code>scheme_eval</code>—but in Scheme! As a reminder, atoms include numbers, booleans, <code>nil</code>, and symbols. You do not need to consider code that contains quasiquotation for this problem.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">(define (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda expr)
  (cond ((atom?   expr) &lt;rewrite atoms&gt;)
        ((quoted? expr) &lt;rewrite quoted expressions&gt;)
        ((lambda? expr) &lt;rewrite lambda expressions&gt;)
        ((define? expr) &lt;rewrite define expressions&gt;)
        ((let?    expr) &lt;rewrite let expressions&gt;)
        (else           &lt;rewrite other expressions&gt;)))</code></pre>



<p><em>Hint 1</em>: Consider how you can use <code>map</code> to convert <code>let</code> forms in every element of a list to the equivalent <code>lambda</code> form.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (zip &#x27;((1 2) (3 4) (5 6)))
((1 3 5) (2 4 6))
scm&gt; (zip &#x27;((1 2)))
((1) (2))
scm&gt; (zip &#x27;())
(() ())</code></pre>



<p><em>Hint 2</em>: In this problem, it may be helpful to build a Scheme list that evaluates to a special form (for instance, a <code>lambda</code> expression). As a related example, the following code builds a scheme list that evaluates to the expression <code>(define (f x) (+ x 1))</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">(let ((name&#x2d;and&#x2d;params &#x27;(f x))
      (body &#x27;(+ x 1)))
  (cons &#x27;define
        (cons name&#x2d;and&#x2d;params (cons body nil))))</code></pre>
